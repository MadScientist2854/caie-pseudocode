# CAIE Pseudocode interpreter
an interpreter for the Cambridge pseudocode specification.

### Not ready for use yet. Development is streamed on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW8CxHiumAsLHYnVxqQR64Q) and [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/madscientist2854) almost daily

to use, install cargo and the rust compiler, and run `cargo run example_src2.txt`  
easier installation and usage will be available once the project is complete

TODO: include what operator precedence is used, as it isn't explicitly stated in the specs
